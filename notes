cloudinary
    - in settings, add upload preset
        - edit transformations (do 325 x 325 scale)
        - for my capstone, do I want the images to be private?
        - security
            - strict transformations - disabled
    - cost
        - free for 25 credits
        - more can get quite expensive (AWS is cheaper)
        - this is why dynamic websites can be so expensive

install these dependencies
    npm install cloudinary-react --save ("--save" saves it to your package.json file)
        - search "cloudinary react" for npm install instructions
    npm install axios --save
    npm install superagent --save
        - very similar to axios (Axios and ajax are two of the most popular. Fetch is new, so not all browsers support it)
    npm install react-dropzone --save

RESTful api (mostly JSON data)
SOAP (mostly XML data)
